### TODO

### v1

- `omitInputAttributes` should apply to generated 'update' mutations
- update mutations should allow updating one level of assocations like create. either way this should be explicit
- Integrations tests against database
- README (lightweight docs)
- Test coverage
- note that crerates/updates only allow one level of associations

### v2

- cli
- crawl database and generate models, types, etc
- operators: recursive
- Recursive creates - currently 1 level deep
